# MathQuest #
There is a lot of evidence showing the benefits of digital games in education. They can help students develop their non-cognitive skills and increase their interest in school subjects (Mackay, 2015).

This project seeks to develop a game that helps children practice basic mathematics whilst providing them with entertainment. The user plays the role of a sheep who must defeat the carnivorous wolves who have taken his friend. Combat takes the form of solving math problems to inflict damage on the enemy. Additionally, the user must solve the set of problems before time runs out.
